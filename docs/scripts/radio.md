The Plugin requires you to be in an RTO channel which is currently CH1 or CH2, We will only use one RTO channel, during patrol.
Once you are in the channel you will be able to hear others as well as talk over the radio.

!!! note
    You must have push to talk setup, or you will not be able to talk over the radio.
